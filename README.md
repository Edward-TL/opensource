A open source projects in Master

A Cohort's Set of basic tools for of each area entusiast. Every set will be revealed after they finish a challenge, so this could boost the feeling of networking between the members of each Path (Front, Back, DS). After they finish the intensive months, they could get the link to the Master's Set of every Path, where, everyone who has been on Platzi Master, could add new functions to the software. Now you could ask "and how it would remain in secret if the idea is that this must be Public?", I think that a not direct name could help, and every Cohort area could choose by voting the proposals of their partners.
